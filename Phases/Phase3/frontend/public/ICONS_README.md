# PWA Icons Required

Please add the following icon files to the `/public` directory:

## Required Files:

1. **icon-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels, PNG format
2. **icon-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels, PNG format

## How to Create Icons:

### Option 1: Use an Online Generator
1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload your logo/icon (square image recommended)
3. Generate icons
4. Download and place in `/public` folder

### Option 2: Manual Creation
1. Create a square logo (512x512 px minimum)
2. Use an image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
3. Export as PNG:
   - 192x192 px → save as `icon-192x192.png`
   - 512x512 px → save as `icon-512x512.png`

### Option 3: Use Favicon Generator
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload your logo
3. Configure settings for PWA
4. Download and extract icons to `/public`

## Quick Temporary Solution:

For testing, you can use the app logo from your sidebar. Just export it as PNG in the required sizes.

The app will work without these icons, but PWA installation won't be available.
